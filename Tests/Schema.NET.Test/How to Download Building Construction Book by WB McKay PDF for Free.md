## The Origins of Building Construction
 
Building construction is an ancient human activity that dates as far back as 400 BC[^3^]. It started from using natural materials such as leaves, branches, and animal hides to produce shelters for regulating the effect of climates on humans. Constructed shelters were one means by which human beings were able to adapt themselves to a wide variety of climates and become a global species[^1^].
 
Early humans built primarily for shelter, using simple methods. Building materials came from the land, and fabrication was dictated by the limits of the materials and the builderâs hands. The erection sequence involved, as now, first placing a foundation (or using the ground). The builder erected the structural system; the structural material (masonry, mud, or logs) served as both skeleton and enclosure[^2^].
 
## The Development of Building Construction
 
Over time, building construction became more complex and sophisticated, as humans developed new skills and technologies. Some of the factors that influenced the development of building construction include:

- The availability and durability of materials. Early building materials were perishable, such as leaves, branches, and animal hides. Later, more durable natural materialsâsuch as clay, stone, and timberâand, finally, synthetic materialsâsuch as brick, concrete, metals, and plastics âwere used[^1^].
- The quest for buildings of ever greater height and span. This was made possible by the development of stronger materials and by knowledge of how materials behave and how to exploit them to greater advantage. Some examples of buildings that demonstrate this quest are the pyramids of Egypt, the cathedrals of Europe, the skyscrapers of New York, and the bridges of San Francisco[^1^].
- The degree of control exercised over the interior environment of buildings. Increasingly precise regulation of air temperature, light and sound levels, humidity, odours, air speed, and other factors that affect human comfort has been possible. This was achieved by using various systems and devices such as fireplaces, windows, fans, air conditioners, heaters, lighting fixtures, insulation materials, soundproofing materials, and sensors[^1^].
- The distinction between architecture and building. Some structures began to have symbolic as well as functional value, marking the beginning of the distinction between architecture and building. Architecture is the art and science of designing buildings that reflect the aesthetic, cultural, social, and environmental values of their creators and users. Building is the practical and technical aspect of constructing buildings according to the design specifications[^1^].

## The Modern Building Construction Industry
 
Today, building construction is a highly specialized and diversified industry that involves many different professionals and tradespeople. Some of the roles and tasks involved in building construction include:

- Architects - They design the overall concept and appearance of buildings, taking into account the needs and preferences of clients, users, and stakeholders. They also prepare drawings and specifications for construction.
- Engineers - They design and analyze the structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, and environmental systems of buildings. They also ensure that buildings comply with codes and standards.
- Contractors - They manage the construction process from start to finish. They hire subcontractors to perform specific tasks such as excavation, foundation work, framing work,
cladding work,
roofing work,
plastering work,
painting work,
flooring work,
plumbing work,
electrical work,
HVAC work,
landscaping work,
etc. They also coordinate with suppliers,
inspectors,
and clients.
- Subcontractors - They perform specialized tasks within their area of expertise under the supervision of contractors. They also provide materials,
equipment,
and labor for their tasks.
- Suppliers - They provide materials,
equipment,
and services for construction projects. They may also offer delivery,
installation,
and maintenance services.
- Inspectors - They check the quality and safety of construction work according to codes and standards. They may also issue permits,
certificates,
and approvals for construction projects.
- Clients - They are the owners or users of buildings who commission construction projects. They may also be involved in financing,
planning,
and decision-making for construction projects.
